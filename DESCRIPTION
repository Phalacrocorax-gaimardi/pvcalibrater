Description: This package extracts a calibrated agent based model for household solar PV + battery adoption in Ireland, based in stated likelihood to adopt survey data (2018). This is an additive model consisting of non-linear financial and social interaction terms along with a barrier-to-adoption term. The calibration is based tree-based gradient-boosting algorithm (XGboost) is used with Shapley scores.
